### Hi there, I'm Stephen

## About Me
I like to build things. I love designing, builing, and creating in almost all forms. I favor problem solving and practicality.

### Professional

#### Work Experiences
- **2022 - Current |** I now work full time in software development and data analysis and utilize python almost daily for scripts and automation. I have greatly contributed to an automation pipeline. It is primarly written in python, but can be activated via command line or jenkins with additional parameters. It performs a file discovery process, discovers differences from what's been ran already, maintains a colorized error log, and and creates specialized job scripts via a homegrown codegen that are then ran in parallel via jenkins. These scripts are generated because the tools ran are a collection of bash scripts, custom tool scripts, java code, etc. All of these scripts get their arguments pre-populated. Overall, this automation pipeline allows the team to perform analysis instead of running tools. Work has been cut down work from multiple-days per task to being able to run 60+ tasks in a few hours generating 200+ GB of data.
- **2020-2021 |** I have completed two 3-5 month programming internships at Northrop Grumman in software engineering roles. The first position I was in had me programming primarly in MATLAB, and the second postion I was in I programmed primarily in Python. 
- **2019** | I also have done a solid amount of IT like tasks in older intership at JTechData as a private contractor.

#### School
- Graduate of University of Alabama in Huntsville w/ 3.8 GPA

### Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- Setting up a Homelab / NAS for my home and exploring the options with it. I'm learning a lot about kubernetese as a system as well as networking.
- Learning SvelteKit tech stack, so that I could build a full-stack website.
- Developing myself physically and mentally.
