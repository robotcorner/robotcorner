### Hi there, I'm Stephen

## About Me
I am senior at The University of Alabama in Huntsville pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering as well as a minor in computer science. I will graduate in may 2022 with a GPA > 3.8.

### Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- Finishing my computer engineering degree (and starting senior design!!!).
- Learning Flutter development, an open source framework for cross platform apps. (in my free time)
- Finding a job to learn faster, develop more, and love working with the people around me. I want to work on things that matter and be surrounded by great, intelligent, people and mentors.

### Programming opinions:
- My favorite language is the right one for the job given time and cost contraints. Usually that means I perfer python because I can work faster in it :)
- I am also facinated with the flutter https://flutter.dev/ programming language and would love to get paid to learn and develop in it. Kotlin has caught my eye too.
- I'm usually not a fan of MATLAB, which I spent multiple semester course wtih, and I did a whole summer internship where I made GUI in this. Python seems to do much the same and not have a licesne fee (business sense anyone?). The argument comes down to developer speed and cost then on top of that, but python is competitive enough these days. I also have completed an internship where I used python, pandas, and DASH with plot.ly to develop a frontend application viewing statistics of data. Python was much less painful and far quicker to develop in.
