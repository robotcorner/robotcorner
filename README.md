### Hi there, I'm Stephen

## About Me
I like to build things. I love designing, builing, and creating in almost all forms. 

### Professional

#### Work Experiences
- I now work full time in software development and data analysis and utilize python almost daily for scripts and automation. I have greatly contributed to an automation pipeline. It is primarly written in python, but can be activated via command line or jenkins with additional parameters. It performs a file discovery process, discovers differences from what's been ran already, maintains a colorized error log, and and creates specialized job scripts via a homegrown codegen that are then ran in parallel via jenkins. These scripts are generated because the tools ran are a collection of bash scripts, custom tool scripts, java code, etc. All of these scripts get their arguments pre-populated. Overally this automation pipeline allows the team to perform analysis instead of running tools. Overall this has cut down work from multiple-days per task to being able to run 60+ tasks in a few hours generating 200+ GB of data.
- I have completed two 3-5 month programming internships in software engineering roles. The first position I was in had me programming primarly in MATLAB, and the second postion I was in I programmed primarily in Python. I also have done a solid amount of IT like tasks in older internship than these.

#### School
- Graduate of University of Alabama in Huntsville 3.8 GPA
- Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
- Minor in Computer Science

### Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- Setting up a Homelab / NAS for my home. This is my shot at exploring kubernetes systems. I'm learning a lot.
- Learning Sveltekit, TailwindCSS + Backends as a tech stack, so that I could build a full-stack website.
- Developing myself physically and mentally.
