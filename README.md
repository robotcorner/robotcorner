### Hi there, I'm Stephen

## About Me
I am senior at The University of Alabama in Huntsville pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering as well as a minor in computer science. I will graduate in may 2022 with a GPA > 3.8. I have completed two 3-5 month programming internships in software engineering roles. The first position I was programming primarly in MATLAB, and the second postion I programmed primarily in Python.

### Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- Finishing my computer engineering degree. I'm in my final semester and taking exams now! 
- Learning Flutter and Dart.js development, an open source framework for cross platform apps. (in my free time)
- Developing myself. I want to work on things that matter and be surrounded by great, intelligent, people and mentors. One of my priorities is having the opportunity to get my code reviewed by people smarter than me so I can improve faster than working without feedback. If I don't code, then my next desire is to lead a team for production of software products.

### Programming opinions:
- My favorite language is the right one for the job given time and cost contraints. Usually that means I perfer python because I can work faster in it :)
- I am also facinated with the flutter https://flutter.dev/ programming language and would love to get paid to learn and develop in it. Kotlin has caught my eye too. Seems like there's a multi-platform theme here... 
- I'm usually not a fan of MATLAB, which I spent multiple semester courses with as well as a whole summer internship where I made GUI in this. Python seems to do much the same and not have a licesne fee (business sense anyone?). The argument comes down to developer speed and cost. Python is competitive enough these days to provide comparable or faster speed of development and no license fees. However MATLAB for signal processing is still cool, and I've used it for such a purpose. I also have completed an internship where I used python, pandas, and DASH with plot.ly to develop a frontend application viewing statistics of data. Python was much less painful and far quicker to develop in with its much larger community support.
