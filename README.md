### Hi there, I'm Stephen

## About Me
I am a graduate of the University of Alabama in Huntsville with a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering as well as a minor in computer science. I graduated in may 2022 with a 3.83 GPA. I have completed two 3-5 month programming internships in software engineering roles. The first position I was  in had me programming primarly in MATLAB, and the second postion I was in I programmed primarily in Python. I now work full time in software development and data analysis.

### Iâ€™m currently working on: 
- Setting up a Homelab / NAS for my home. This is my shot at exploring kubernetes, docker, unraid, proxmox VE, etc. I'm learning a lot.
- Learning Svelte, Sveltekit, TailwindCSS + Backends as a tech stack, so that I could build a full-stack website.
- Developing myself. I want to work on things that matter and be surrounded by great, intelligent, people and mentors. One of my priorities is having the opportunity to get my code reviewed by people smarter than me so I can improve faster than working without feedback. If I'm not coding, then I would like to lead a team that is.
